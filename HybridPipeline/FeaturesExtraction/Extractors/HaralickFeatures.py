    # These features capture texture properties like contrast, correlation, entropy, and homogeneity,
    # which are useful for characterizing patterns, surfaces, or regions in an image.
    #
    # The `haralick` function computes these features in multiple directions (e.g., 0째, 45째, 90째, 135째).
    # To get a single representative feature vector, we take the mean across all directions.
    #
    # This results in a 13-dimensional feature vector that summarizes the image's texture characteristics.
