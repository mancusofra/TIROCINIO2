    # and are useful for capturing brightness, contrast, and overall texture characteristics.
    #
    # 1. Ensure pixel values are in the [0, 255] range. If the image is normalized (0â€“1),
    #    rescale it to 8-bit format.
    # 2. Flatten the image for easier computation of global statistics.
    #
    # Extracted features:
    # - Mean: average brightness of the image.
    # - Standard deviation: contrast or spread of intensities.
    # - Kurtosis: how heavy/light the tails of the distribution are (sharpness/flatness).
    # - Skewness: asymmetry of the histogram (left/right bias).
    # - Entropy: measure of randomness or texture complexity in the image.
    #
    # These 5 values form a compact descriptor for grayscale intensity distribution.
